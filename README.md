💡 Future Improvements
This project has a great foundation! Here are some exciting ideas for future enhancements:

●👤 More Detailed User Profile:
○Add fields for height, age, gender, and activity level ( sedentary 🛋, light 󰣰,
moderate 󰝊, active 󰝯) to create a much more accurate and truly personalized plan.

● ⚙ Advanced Plan Generation:
  ○ Implement calorie and macronutrient (protein, carbs, fat) calculations 📊.
  ○ Integrate a food API (like Edamam or Spoonacular) for a huge variety of meal options
    and their nutritional info 📚.
  ○ Add options for dietary restrictions and preferences (e.g., vegetarian 🥦, vegan 🌱,
    gluten-free 🍞, allergies 🥜).
    
● 🔐 User Accounts & Data Persistence:
  ○ Add user authentication (login/signup) 🔑.
  ○ Use a database (like Firebase Firestore) to save user profiles and their generated diet
    plans, allowing them to track progress over time 📈

●🌟 Enhanced User Experience (UX):
  ○ Generate a full week's plan instead of just one day 🗓.
  ○ Allow users to swap out meals they don't like 🔄.
  ○ Add a feature to print 🖨 or export the diet plan as a PDF.
